# Now let us print the contents of the vocabulary to get a better understanding of the underlying concepts:

print(count.vocabulary_)

# As we can see from executing the preceding command, the vocabulary is stored in a Python dictionary, which maps the unique words that are mapped to integer indices. Next let us print the feature vectors that we just created:
# Each index position in the feature vectors shown here corresponds to the integer values that are stored as dictionary items in the CountVectorizer vocabulary. For example, the  rst feature at index position 0 resembles the count of the word and, which only occurs in the last document, and the word is at index position 1 (the 2nd feature in the document vectors) occurs in all three sentences. Those values in the feature vectors are also called the raw term frequencies: *tf (t,d)*â€”the number of times a term t occurs in a document *d*.
